# tbd-react-try-3

This is the project we created during the presentation.

## To start

* Run `yarn` to install the dependencies
* Run `yarn start` to start the local development webserver

## Presentation

* [First talk PDF](tbd-react.pdf)
* [Second talk PDF](tbd-react-102.pdf) - we got up to the first slide about _react-router_


## Other tries 

* https://github.com/ckuijjer/tbd-react - Routing and a Dialog with an Escape handler instead of a FullscreenImage
* https://github.com/ckuijjer/tbd-react-try-2 - Rehearsal that's hopefully exactly the same as this one
